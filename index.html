            <h4><a href="">Burns and Scalds</a></h4>
            <p>Burns can be caused through dry heat such as fire or hot metal or contact with an object charged with a high tension electric current, or friction with a revolving wheel or fast-moving rope. Additionally, chemical burns occur with corrosive chemicals like acids and alkalis.There may be reddening of the skin or blister formation or destruction of the skin, or of the deeper tissues.The areas of most burns and scalds, including the clothing are sterile for a short period, and efforts should be made to keep them so until medical aid is possible.

General rules for treatment:-
1. Avoid handling the affected area more than necessary. See that your hands are as clean as possible by washing them.
2. Do not apply lotions of any kind.
3. Do not remove burned clothing and do not break blisters.
4. Cover the area (including burned clothing), with a dry sterile dressing if possible, or similar material such as clean lint, freshly-laundered linen.
5. Bandage firmly, except when blisters are present or suspected, in which case, bandage lightly.
6. Immobilise the area by suitable means.

In case of a major burn, move the patient to the hospital as quickly as possible. The patient will probably require an anaesthetic, so don’t give any oral medicines.

If the burns are caused by a corrosive chemical:-
For acids:-
1. Thoroughly flood the part with water.
2. Bathe the part freely with an alkaline solution made from two teaspoons of baking soda or washing soda in one pint of warm water.
 
For alkalis:-
1. If the burn is caused by quicklime, brush off any remains.
2. Bathe the part freely with a weak acid solution, such as vinegar or lemon juice, diluted with an equal quantity of warm water.</p>

            <h4><a href="">Heart Attack/Chest Pain</a></h4>
            <p>Someone having a heart attack may have any or all of the following:
Chest pain, pressure or tightness, or a squeezing or aching sensation in the center of the chest
Pain or discomfort that spreads to the shoulder, arm, back, neck, jaw, teeth or occasionally upper abdomen,
Nausea. Some heart attacks strike suddenly, but many people have warning signs hours or days in advance.

What to do if you or someone else may be having a heart attack
Call 911 or your local emergency number. Don't ignore the symptoms of a heart attack. If you can't get an ambulance or emergency vehicle to come to you, have a neighbor or a friend drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only if you have no other option. Because your condition can worsen, driving yourself puts you and others at risk.
Chew and swallow an aspirin while waiting for emergency help. Aspirin helps keep your blood from clotting. When taken during a heart attack, it could reduce heart damage. Don't take aspirin if you are allergic to it or have been told by your doctor never to take aspirin.
Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed. If you think you're having a heart attack and your doctor has previously prescribed nitroglycerin for you, take it as directed while waiting for emergency medical help.
Begin CPR if the person is unconscious. If the person isn't breathing or you don't find a pulse, begin CPR to keep blood flowing after you call for emergency medical help.

Push hard and fast on the center of the person's chest in a fairly rapid rhythm — about 100 to 120 compressions a minute.

If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is immediately available and the person is unconscious, follow the device instructions for using it.</p>

            <h4><a href="">Major Cuts</a></h4>
            <p>Major cuts, or wounds can be classified as follows:-

· Incised wounds, caused by a sharp instrument like a razor.
· Lacerated wounds, which have torn and irregular edges, caused by machinery, animal claws, etc.
· Contused wounds, accompanied by bruising of the tissues, caused by a direct blow or by crushing.
· Puncture wounds, which have comparatively small openings, but may be very deep, caused by a stab from any sharp-pointed instrument, like a needle, knife or bayonet.


 
In case of wounds, follow the steps below:-
1. Place patient in a suitable position, elevating the bleeding part, unless it is a fractured limb.
2. Do not disturb any blood clots formed.
3. Removing as little clothing as possible, expose the wound.
4. Remove any foreign bodies which are visible, and can be easily picked out or wiped off with a clean dressing.
6. Apply and maintain both direct and indirect pressure.
7. Apply a clean dressing and bandage.
8. Immobilise the injured part. When the wound is near a joint, immobilise it using splints if needed.

Remember, that if there is a foreign body in the wound which cannot be removed easily, cover it with a dressing, and build up sufficient pads around the wound without applying pressure to the foreign body.

If there is no foreign body in the wound, but the cut is deep, ensure that you use enough padding into the wound’s depths, and ensure pads project well above the level of the skin to ensure adequate pressure on the torn ends of the blood vessels.</p>

            <h4><a href="">Heat Stroke</a></h4>
            <p>Heatstroke occurs when your body temperature rises rapidly and you're unable to cool down. It can be life-threatening by causing damage to your brain and other vital organs. It may be caused by strenuous activity in the heat or by being in a hot place for too long.

Heatstroke can occur without any previous heat-related condition, such as heat exhaustion. Heatstroke signs and symptoms include:

Fever of 104 F (40 C) or greater
Changes in mental status or behavior, such as confusion, agitation, slurred speech
Hot, dry skin or heavy sweating
Nausea and vomiting
Flushed skin
Rapid pulse
Rapid breathing
Headache
Fainting, which may be the first sign in older adults
Seek emergency medical care
If you suspect heatstroke, call 911 or your local emergency number. Then immediately move the person out of the heat, remove excess clothing, and cool him or her by whatever means available, for example:

Place in a tub of cool water or a cool shower.
Spray with a garden hose.
Sponge with cool water.
Fan while misting with cool water.
Place ice packs or cool wet towels on the neck, armpits and groin.
Cover with cool damp sheets.
Let the person drink cool water to rehydrate, if he or she is able. Don't give sugary, caffeinated or alcoholic beverages to a person with heatstroke. Also avoid very cold drinks, as these can cause stomach cramps.

Begin CPR if the person loses consciousness and shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing or movement.</p>

            <h4><a href="">Fractures</a></h4>
            <p>A simple fracture is when there is no wound leading down to the broken bone.

General symptoms and signs of a fracture:-
1. Pain at or near the seat of fracture
2. Tenderness or discomfort on general pressure over the fractured area
3. Swelling about the seat of fracture. This swelling frequently renders it difficult to perceive other signs of fracture and care must be taken not to underestimate the seriousness of the condition.
4. Deformity of the limb
5. The irregularity of the bone

General rules for treatment of fractures.

1. Treat the fracture on the spot
Don’t move the patient till the injured part has been immobilised unless life is in immediate danger from some other cause. If, however, circumstances are such that final immobilisation cannot be completed on the spot, carry out a temporary fix to enable the patient to be moved for a short distance to more suitable and safe surroundings. Haemorrhage and severe wounds must be dealt with before continuing with the treatment of fractures, with due regard to requirements of both types of injuries.
2. Steady and support the injured parts at once, so that movement is impossible. This prevents further injury and the increase in the bleeding which always takes place at the site of the fracture. It also prevents broken bone ends from piercing or damaging the skin, blood vessels, nerves or muscles.
3. Immobilise the fracture by the use of bandages or the use of splints.
Using the patient’s body as a means of support, application of bandages would be adequate. Additional support of splints may be required when there is a possibility of long or difficult transport before medical aid is possible. Splints are required when both lower limbs are fractured.

The use of bandages:-
Never apply a bandage over the site of a fracture. They must be applied sufficiently firmly to prevent harmful movements, but not so tightly as to prevent the circulation of blood.

In the case of a fractured limb, further swelling may occur, causing the bandage to become too tight. Should this occur, loosen them at once to allow normal circulation to return. Padding must always be placed between the ankles and knees if these are tied together.

            <h4><a href="">Bites/Stings</a></h4>
            <p>For ordinary bee stings that do not cause an allergic reaction, home treatment is enough. Multiple stings or an allergic reaction, on the other hand, can be a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment.

Emergency treatment for allergic reactions
During an anaphylactic attack, an emergency medical team may perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if you stop breathing or your heart stops beating. You may be given medications including:

Epinephrine (adrenaline) to reduce your body's allergic response
Oxygen, to help you breathe
Intravenous (IV) antihistamines and cortisone to reduce inflammation of your air passages and improve breathing
A beta agonist (such as albuterol) to relieve breathing symptoms
Epinephrine autoinjector
If you're allergic to bee stings, your doctor is likely to prescribe an emergency epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen, Auvi-Q, others). You'll need to have it with you at all times. An autoinjector is a combined syringe and concealed needle that injects a single dose of medication when pressed against your thigh. Always be sure to replace epinephrine by its expiration date.

Be sure you know how to use the autoinjector. Also, make sure the people closest to you know how to administer the drug — if they're with you in an anaphylactic emergency, they could save your life. Medical personnel called in to respond to a severe anaphylactic reaction also may give you an epinephrine injection or another medication.

Consider wearing an alert bracelet that identifies your allergy to bee or other insect stings.

Allergy shots
Bee and other insect stings are a common cause of anaphylaxis. If you've had a serious reaction to a bee sting or multiple stings, your doctor likely will refer you to an allergist for allergy testing and consideration of allergy shots (immunotherapy). These shots, generally given regularly for a few years, can reduce or eliminate your allergic response to bee venom.</p>

            <h4><a href="">Electrical Shock</a></h4>
            <p>The danger from an electrical shock depends on the type of current, how high the voltage is, how the current traveled through the body, the person's overall health and how quickly the person is treated.

An electrical shock may cause burns, or it may leave no visible mark on the skin. In either case, an electrical current passing through the body can cause internal damage, cardiac arrest or other injury. Under certain circumstances, even a small amount of electricity can be fatal.

When to contact your doctor
A person who has been injured by contact with electricity should be seen by a doctor.

Caution
Don't touch the injured person if he or she is still in contact with the electrical current.
Call 911 or your local emergency number if the source of the burn is a high-voltage wire or lightning. Don't get near high-voltage wires until the power is turned off. Overhead power lines usually aren't insulated. Stay at least 20 feet (about 6 meters) away — farther if wires are jumping and sparking.
Don't move a person with an electrical injury unless he or she is in immediate danger.
When to seek emergency care
Call 911 or your local emergency number if the injured person experiences:

Severe burns
Confusion
Difficulty breathing
Heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias)
Cardiac arrest
Muscle pain and contractions
Seizures
Loss of consciousness
Take these actions immediately while waiting for medical help:

Turn off the source of electricity, if possible. If not, move the source away from you and the person, using a dry, nonconducting object made of cardboard, plastic or wood.
Begin CPR if the person shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing or movement.
Try to prevent the injured person from becoming chilled.
Apply a bandage. Cover any burned areas with a sterile gauze bandage, if available, or a clean cloth. Don't use a blanket or towel, because loose fibers can stick to the burns.</p>

            <h4><a href="">Seizures</a></h4>
            <p>Choking occurs when a foreign object lodges in the throat or windpipe, blocking the flow of air. In adults, a piece of food often is the culprit. Young children often swallow small objects. Because choking cuts off oxygen to the brain, give first aid as quickly as possible.

The universal sign for choking is hands clutched to the throat. If the person doesn't give the signal, look for these indications:

Inability to talk
Difficulty breathing or noisy breathing
Squeaky sounds when trying to breathe
Cough, which may either be weak or forceful
Skin, lips and nails turning blue or dusky
Skin that is flushed, then turns pale or bluish in color
Loss of consciousness
If the person is able to cough forcefully, the person should keep coughing. If the person is choking and can't talk, cry or laugh forcefully, the American Red Cross recommends a "five-and-five" approach to delivering first aid:

Give 5 back blows. Stand to the side and just behind a choking adult. For a child, kneel down behind. Place one arm across the person's chest for support. Bend the person over at the waist so that the upper body is parallel with the ground. Deliver five separate back blows between the person's shoulder blades with the heel of your hand.
Give 5 abdominal thrusts. Perform five abdominal thrusts (also known as the Heimlich maneuver).
Alternate between 5 blows and 5 thrusts until the blockage is dislodged.
The American Heart Association doesn't teach the back blow technique, only the abdominal thrust procedures. It's OK not to use back blows if you haven't learned the technique. Both approaches are acceptable.

If the person becomes unconscious, perform standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with chest compressions and rescue breaths.</p>

            <h4><a href="">Bleeding</a></h4>
            <p>If someone is bleeding heavily, the main aim is to prevent further blood loss and minimise the effects of shock (see below).

First, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance as soon as possible.

If you have disposable gloves, use them to reduce the risk of any infection being passed on.

Check that there's nothing embedded in the wound. If there is, take care not to press down on the object.

Instead, press firmly on either side of the object and build up padding around it before bandaging, to avoid putting pressure on the object itself.

If nothing is embedded:

apply and maintain pressure to the wound with your gloved hand, using a clean pad or dressing if possible; continue to apply pressure until the bleeding stops 
use a clean dressing to bandage the wound firmly
if bleeding continues through the pad, apply pressure to the wound  until the bleeding stops and then apply another pad over the top and bandage it in place; don't remove the original pad or dressing, but continue to check that the bleeding has stopped 
If a body part, such as a finger, has been severed, place it in a plastic bag or wrap it in cling film and make sure it goes with the casualty to hospital.

Always seek medical help for bleeding unless it's minor.

If someone has a nosebleed that hasn't stopped after 20 minutes, go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department.

Read more about how to treat minor bleeding from cuts and grazes and how to treat nosebleeds.

Haemostatic dressings and tourniquets
In certain situations, where bleeding is very severe and from the body’s extremities, such as the head, neck and torso, it may be appropriate to use haemostatic dressings or a tourniquet.

Haemostatic dressings contain properties that help the blood to clot (thicken) quicker. A tourniquet is a band that's wrapped tightly around a limb to stop blood loss. Haemostatic dressings and tourniquets should only be used by people who have been trained to apply them.</p>
