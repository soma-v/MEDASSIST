# MEDASSIST
Healthcare AI based project for Code2Create 5.0 (2021) by ACM VIT

ABOUT THE IDEA:

Our idea is to build a web-based application that can help people during medical emergencies. With the AI-based disease prediction system, the application will be able to determine the possible health risk from the observed symptoms and the level of risk. The application will also direct the user about the medical assistance that is required to deal with that particular emergency. Our application will find the nearest possible healthcare centres for the user. The one-click emergency feature will help the user to call the ambulance immediately by sharing the user’s live location and the details about the symptoms and predicted health risks. The application will also send emergency messages to the user’s family members/emergency contacts.

FEATURES:

1)	Login/signup feature: the user will be able to create his/her account and store the details about any prior health condition or disease that he/she has been diagnosed with, past and present medications
2)	Emergency contacts feature: lets the user store the contact details of as many members he/she wants to 
3)	AI disease/health risk prediction from the observed symptoms: this will predict the health condition of the person and generate a report of the risk level and immediate first-aid that should be taken
4)	The map feature will list out the user’s current location and show all the nearest healthcare centres 
5)	Emergency feature: This will send the user’s live location, the symptom’s details and predicted health condition report to the health care centre and call for an ambulance

GOOD TO HAVE FEATURE:

1)	All information’s and details in the user’s profile will be secure and confidential
2)	There will be an option for the user to choose who the patient is and accordingly the diagnosis report will be sent to the respective patient’s emergency contacts.
3)	Detecting the real-time location of the user and identifying the nearest possible health care centre.
4)	Providing detailed diagnosis of the symptoms with health risk chart and risk level indicator and proper steps of first-aid that can keep the situation under control till the ambulance arrived
